A simple IDE for stepping though a simple pseudo-code defined by professors for a cmput 101 class.

Step through the code line by line with a view of all variables and their values.

Designed for use as a computing science teaching tool for students who never plan on taking more computing science.

The code is currently a NetBeans 6.5 project.
